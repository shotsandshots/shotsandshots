## hi my name is pawer and i am pro-ship/pro-fic. please dont ask me if im a darkshipper or comshipper or what ever because im a grown adult with wrist and back pain and i dont know that means. i use periods a lot and im a chronic drytexter.
## obligatory dni:
- im pro-para but pro/neutral contact people dni.
- dont talk to me if you still unironically think that unconventional queer identities are somehow dangerous or "invalid" (whatever that means).
- ^- especially if it has to do with lesboys i suck mad lesboy clit.
